 Implementation Guidance for the PKCS #1 RSA Cryptography Specification
                      draft-kario-rsa-guidance-02

Abstract

   This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC 8017.
   Specifically, it provides guidance to implementers of the standard to
   protect against side-channel attacks.  It also deprecates the PKCS #1
   v1.5 encryption padding, but provides an alternative depadding
   algorithm that protects against side-channel attacks raising from
   users of vulnerable APIs.  The purpose of this specification is to
   increase security of RSA implementations.

1.  Introduction

   The PKCS #1 [RFC8017] specification describes the RSA cryptosystem,
   providing guidance on implementing encryption schemes and signature
   schemes.

   Unfortunately, typical uses of RSA encryption schemes leave it
   vulnerable to side-channel attacks.  Protections against them are not
   documented there, and attacks are mentioned only in passing.

2.  Rationale

   The PKCS #1 v1.5 padding is known to be problematic since 1998, when
   Daniel Bleichenbacher published his attack.  Side-channel attacks
   against public key implementations, including RSA, are known to be
   possible since 1996 thanks to work by Paul Kocher.  Despite those
   results, side-channel attacks against RSA implementations have
   proliferated for the next 25 years.

   We thus provide guidance how to implement those algorithms in a way
   that should be secure against at least the simple timing side channel
   attacks.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Notation

   In this document we reuse the notation from RFC 8017, in addition, we
   define the following:

   AL  alternative message length, non-negative integer, 0 <= AL <= k -
      11

   AM  alternative encoded message, an octet string

   bb  base blinding factor, a positive integer

   bbInv  base un-blinding factor, a positive integer,

        bbInv = bb^(-1) mod n

   D  octet string representation of d

   DH  an octet string of a SHA-256 hash of D

   KDK  an octet string containing a Key Derivation Key for a specific
      ciphertext C

   l  length in octets of the message M

   b_i  an exponent blinding factor for i-th prime, non-negative
      integer.

5.  Side channel attacks

   Cryptographic implementations may provide a lot of indirect signals
   to the attacker that includes information about the secret processed
   data.  Depending on type of information, those leaks can be used to
   decrypt data or retrieve private keys.  Most common side-channels
   that leak information about secret data are:

   1.  Different errors returned

   2.  Different processing times of operations

   3.  Different patterns of jump instructions and memory accesses

   4.  Use of hardware instructions that take different amount time to
       execute depending on operands or result

   Some of those leaks may be detectable over the network, while others
   may require closer access to the attacked system.  With closer
   access, the attacker may be able to measure power usage,
   electromagnetic emanations, or sounds and correlate them with
   specific bits of secret information.

   Recent research into network based side channel detection has shown
   that even very small side channels (of just few clock cycles) can be
   reliably detected over the network.  The detectability depends on the
   sample size the attacker is able to collect, not on size of the side-
   channel.

6.  General recommendations

   As a general rule, all operations that process secret information (be
   it parts of the private key or parts of encrypted message) MUST be
   performed with code that doesn't have secret data dependent branch
   instructions, secret data dependent memory accesses, or uses non-
   constant time machine instructions (which ones are those is
   architecture dependant, but division is commonly non-constant time).

   Special care should be placed around the code that handles the
   conversion of the numerical representation to the octet string
   representation in RSA decryption operations.

   All operations that use private keys SHOULD additionally employ both
   base blinding and exponent blinding as protections against leaks
   inside modular exponentiation code.

7.  Side-channel free modular exponentiation

   The underlying modular exponentiation algorithm MUST be constant time
   with regards to the exponent in all uses of the private key.

   For private key decryption the modular exponentiation algorithm MUST
   be constant time with regards to the output of the exponentiation.

   In case the Chinese remainder theorem optimisation is used the
   modular exponentiation algorithm must also be constant time with
   regards to the used moduli.

7.1.  General recommendations

   It's especially important to make sure that all values that are
   secret to the attacker are stored in memory buffers that have sizes
   determined by the public modulus.

   For example, the private exponents should be stored in memory buffers
   that have sizes determined by the public modulus value, not the
   numerical values of the exponents themselves.

   Similarly, the size of the output buffer for multiplication should
   always be equal to the sum of buffer sizes of multiplicands.  The
   output size of the modular reduction operation should similarly be
   equal to the size of the modulus and not depend on bit size of the
   output.

7.2.  Montgomery ladder

   For the modular exponentiation algorithm to be side-channel free
   every step of the calculation MUST NOT depend on the bits of the
   exponent.  In particular, use of simple square and multiply algorithm
   will leak information about bits of the exponent through lack of
   multiplication operation in individual exponentiation steps.

   The recommended workaround against it, is the use of the Montgomery
   ladder construction.

   While that approach ensures that both the square and multiply
   operations are performed, the fact that the results of them are
   placed in different memory locations based on bits of the secret
   exponent will provide enough information for an attacker to recover
   the bits of the exponent.  To counteract it, the implementation
   should ensure that both memory locations are accessed and updated on
   every step.

7.3.  Montgomery reduction in multiplication

   As multiplication operations quickly make the intermediate values in
   modular exponentiation large, performing a modular reduction after
   every multiplication or squaring operation is a common optimisation.

   To further optimise the modular reduction, the Montgomery modular
   multiplication is used for performing the combined multiply-and-
   reduce operation.  The last step of that operation is conditional on
   the value of the output.  A side-channel free implementation should
   perfom the subtraction in all cases and then copy the result or the
   first operand of the subtraction based on sign of the result of the
   subtraction.

8.  Base blinding

   As a protection against multiple attacks, it's RECOMMENDED to perform
   all operations involving the private key with the use of blinding
   [Kocher96].

   It should be noted that for decryption operations the unblinding
   operation MUST be performed using side-channel free code that does
   not leak information about the result of this multiplication and
   reduction modulo operation.

   To implement base blinding, select a number bb uniformly at random
   such that it is relatively prime to n and smaller than n.

   Compute multiplicative inverse of bb modulo n.

     bbInv = bb^(-1) mod n

   In the RSADP() operation, after performing step 1, multiply c by bb
   mod n.  Use the result as new c for all the remaining operations.

   Before returning the value m in step 3, multiply it by bbInv mod n.

   Note: multiplication by bbInv and reduction modulo n MUST be
   performed using side-channel free code with respect to value m.

   As calculating multiplicative inverse is expensive, implementations
   MAY calculate new values of bb and bbInv by squaring them:

     new bb = bb^2 mod n
     new bbInv = bbInv^2 mod n

   A given pair of blinding factors (bb, bbInv) MUST NOT be used for
   more than one RSADP() operation.

Internet-Draft         RSA Implementation Guidance          October 2023


   Unless the multiplication (squaring) and reduction modulo operations
   are verified to be side-channel free, it's RECOMMENDED to generate
   completely new blinding parameters every few hundred private key
   operations.

9.  Exponent blinding

   To further protect against private key leaks, it's RECOMMENDED to
   perform the blinding of the used exponents [Kocher96].

   When performing the RSADP() operation, the blinding depends on the
   form of the private key.

   If the key is in the first form, the pair (n, d), then the exponent d
   should be modified by adding a multiple of Euler phi(n): m = c^(d +
   b*phi(n)) mod n.  Where b is a 64 bit long uniform random number.

   A new value b MUST be selected for every RSADP() operation.

   If the key is the second form, the quintuple (p, q, dP, dQ, qInv)
   with optional sequence of triplets (r_i, d_i, t_i), i = 3, ..., u,
   then each exponent used MUST be blinded individually.

   1.  The m_1 = c^(dP + b_1 * phi(p)) mod p

   2.  The m_2 = c^(dQ + b_2 * phi(q)) mod q

   3.  If u > 3, then m_i = c^(d_i + b_i * phi(r_i)) mod (r_i)

   Where b_1, b_2, ..., b_i are all uniformly selected random numbers at
   least 64 bits long (or at least 2 machine word sizes, whichever is
   greater).

   As Euler phi(p) for an argument p that's a prime is equal p - 1, it's
   simple to calculate in this case.

   Note: the selection of random b_i values, multiplication of them by
   the result of phi() function, and addition to the exponent MUST be
   performed with side-channel free code.

   Use of smaller blinding factor is NOT RECOMMENDED, as values shorter
   than 64 bits have been shown to still be vulnerable to side-channel
   attacks[Bauer12][Schindler11].

   The b_1, b_2, ..., b_i factors MUST NOT be reused for multiple
   RSADP() operations.

10.  Depadding

   In case of RSA-OAEP, the padding is self-verifying, thus the
   depadding operation needs to follow the standard algorithm to provide
   a safe API to users.

   It MUST ignore the value of the very fist octet of padding and
   process the remaining bytes as if it was equal zero.

   The PKCS #1 v1.5 padding is considered deprecated, and should be used
   only to process legacy data.  It MUST NOT be used as part of online
   protocols or API endpoints.

   For implementations that can't remove support for this padding mode
   it's RECOMMENDED to implement an implicit rejection mechanism that
   completely hides from the calling code whether the padding check
   failed or not.

   It should be noted that the algorithm MUST be implemented as stated,
   otherwise in case of heteregonous environments where two
   implementations use the same key but implement the implicit rejection
   differently, it may be possible for the attacker to compare behaviour
   between the implementations to guess if the padding check failed or
   not.

   The basic idea of the implicit rejection is to prepare a random but
   deterministic message to be returned in case the standard PKCS #1
   v1.5 padding checks fail.  To do that, use the private key and the
   provided ciphertext to derive a static, but unknown to the attacker,
   random value.  It's a combination of the method documented in the TLS
   1.2 (RFC 5246[RFC5246]) and the deterministic (EC)DSA signatures (RFC
   6979 [RFC6979]).

10.1.  IRPRF

   For the calculation of the random message for implicit rejection we
   define a Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) as follows:

   IRPRF( KDK, label, length )

   Input:

   KDK the key derivation key

   label a label making the output unique for a given KDK

   length requested length of output in octets




Kario                     Expires 20 April 2024                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         RSA Implementation Guidance          October 2023


   Output: derived key, an octet string

   Steps:

   1.  If KDK is not 32 octets long, or if length is larger than 8192
       return error and stop.

   2.  The returned value is created by concatenation of subsequent
       calls to a SHA-256 HMAC function with the KDK as the HMAC key and
       following octet string as the message:

        P_i = I || label || bitLength

   3.  Where the I is an iterator value encoded as two octet long big
       endian integer, label is the passed in label, and bitLength is
       the length times 8 (to represent number of bits of output)
       encoded as two octet big endian integer.  The iterator is
       initialised to 0 on first call, and then incremented by 1 for
       every subsequent HMAC call.

   4.  The HMAC is iterated until the concatenated output is shorter
       than length

   5.  The output is the length left-most octets of the concatenated
       HMAC output

10.2.  Implicit rejection

   For implementations that cannot remove support for the PKCS #1 v1.5
   padding nor provide a usage-specific API, it's possible to implement
   an implicit rejection algorithm as a protection measure.  It should
   be noted that implementing it correctly is hard, thus it's
   RECOMMENDED instead to disable support for PKCS #1 v1.5 padding
   instead.

   To implement implicit rejection, the RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5-DECRYPT from
   section 7.2.2 of RFC 8017 needs to be implemented as follows:

   1.  Length checking: If the length of the ciphertext C is not k
       octets (or if k < 11), output "decryption error" and stop.

   2.  RSA decryption:

       a.  Convert the ciphertext C to an integer ciphertext
           representative c:

            c = OS2IP (C).

Internet-Draft         RSA Implementation Guidance          October 2023


       b.  Apply the RSADP decryption primitive to the RSA private key
           (n, d) and the ciphertext representative c to produce an
           integer message representative m:

            m = RSADP ((n, d), c).

           Note: the RSADP MUST be constant-time with respect of message
           m.

           If RSADP outputs "ciphertext representative out of range"
           (meaning that c >= n), output "decryption error" and stop.

       c.  Convert the message representative m to an encoded message EM
           of length k octets:

            EM = I2OSP (m, k).

           Note: I2OSP MUST be constant-time with respect of m.

   3.  Derivation of alternative message

       1.  Derive the Key Derivation Key (KDK)

           a.  Convert the private expoent d to a string of length k
               octets:

                D = I2OSP (d, k).

           b.  Hash the private exponent using the SHA-256 algorithm:

                DH = SHA256 (D).

               Note: This value MAY be cached between the decryption
               operations, but MUST be considered private-key
               equivalent.

           c.  Use the DH as the SHA-256 HMAC key and the provided
               ciphertext C as the message.  If the ciphertext C is not
               k octets long, it MUST be left padded with octets of
               value zero.

                KDK = HMAC (DH, C, SHA256).

       2.  Create the candidate lengths and the random message

           a.  Use the IRPRF with key KDK, "length" as six octet label
               encoded with UTF-8, to generate 256 octet output.
               Interpret this output as 128 two octet long big-endian
               numbers.

                CL = IRPRF (KDK, "length", 256).

           b.  Use the IRPRF with key KDK, "message" as a seven octet
               label encoded with UTF-8 to generate k octet long output
               to be used as the alternative message:

                AM = IRPRF (KDK, "message", k).

       3.  Select the alternative length for the alternative message.

           Note: this must be performed in side-channel free way.

           a.  Iterate over the 128 candidate CL lengths.  For each zero
               out high order bits so that they have the same bit length
               as the maximum valid message size (k - 11).

           b.  Select the last length that's not larger than k - 11, use
               0 if none are.  Save it as AL.

   4.  EME-PKCS1-v1_5 decoding: Separate the encoded message EM into an
       octet string PS consisting of nonzero octets and a message M as

        EM = 0x00 || 0x02 || PS || 0x00 || M.

       If the first octet of EM does not have hexadecimal value 0x00, if
       the second octet of EM does not have hexadecimal value 0x02, if
       there is no octet with hexadecimal value 0x00 to separate PS from
       M, or if the length of PS is less than 8 octets, the check
       variable must remember if any of those checks failed.
       Irrespective of the check variable value, the code should also
       return length of message M: L.  If there is no octet with
       hexadecimal value 0x00 to separate PS from M, then L should equal
       0.

       Note: All those checks MUST be performed irrespective if previous
       checks failed or not.  A common technique for that is to have a
       check variable that is OR-ed with the results of subsequent
       checks.

   5.  Decision which message to return: in case the check variable is
       set, the code should return the last AL octets of AM, in case the
       check variable is unset the code should return the last L octets
       of EM.

Internet-Draft         RSA Implementation Guidance          October 2023


       Note: The decision which length to use MUST be performed in side-
       channel free manner.  While the length of the returned message is
       not considered sensitive, the read memory location is.  As such,
       when returning message M both EM and AM memory locations MUST be
       read.

11.  Deprecated Algorithms

   Current protocol deployments MUST NOT use encryption with RSA PKCS #1
   v1.5 padding.  Support for RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 SHOULD be disabled in
   default configuration of any implementation of RSA cryptosystem.  All
   new protocols MUST NOT specify PKCS #1 v1.5 as a valid encryption
